===========

This is my implementation for the Euclidean division algorithm, it makes the appropriate checks and exceptions. 
It also deals with negative values and if one value passed is larger than the other. This is strictly for integers.
Here are some examples:


gcd1(33,-777) = 3

gcd1(777, 33) = 3 

gcd1(4023, 17) = 1

gcd1(45, 3) = 3

gcd1(1234568, 6788) = 4

gcd1(1234321, 6787) = 11
